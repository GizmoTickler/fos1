# Internal Packages

This directory contains internal packages that are not intended for use outside of this project.

## Directory Structure

- `utils/` - Common utilities and helper functions
- Other internal packages will be added as needed

## Package Design

Internal packages follow the same design principles as the core packages but are not intended to be imported by external projects. These packages may change without notice and should not be relied upon by code outside of this repository.
